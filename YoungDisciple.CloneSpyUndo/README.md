# CloneSpy Undoer
This program finds shortcut .lnk files created by CloneSpy, and undoes what CloneSpy did.

* it finds the file the shortcut .lnk points to
* copies it to the filder where the .lnk file is, giving it the same name as the .lnk file (without the .lnk extension)
* then deletes the .lnk file.

This program is very basic and should be considered _work in progress_. It was helpful to me, and worked well for me. 

_However use completely at your own risk!_
